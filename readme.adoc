== Introduction

This is the first project for 2022.  Happy New Year, hopefully we will be out of the Human Malware (Covid-19).

The how to build videos and examples were a bit difficult to understand.
There didn't appear to be any reference to the Microphone and Bluetooth modules.

A Otto repository was created to capture everything about Otto in one place.
This will include PDF rendered documents, YouTube Videos and software libraries.

== Construction

This is not a 2 hour build, it is more like a 3-4 hour build.

The screwdriver provided with the kit is nice but you might need the following

* Diagonal cutter, flush cut
* Rotary Tool
* Extra screws (They seem to vanish into another dimension)
* Hot glue
* UV Glue
* Hobby knife
* Hammer (Utter frustration)

Some observations on the construction

* Test fit *ALL* parts like buzzer, on/off switch.  There will be sanding or dremel required
* Trim and clean up all the 3d printed parts, it will go much easier later
* Build the bottom first, align the servos
* Enlarge the holes for the power jack and USB jack, they do not align easily
* Get a better screwdriver or end up with a lot of useless phillips head screw
difficult to get out
* Test fit the motor control board into the case with *NO* jumpers attached
* Touch sensor needs to be installed, taped in place, before fitting motor controller board
* Testing the alignment may cause a leg to get stuck and in turn strip the servo arms.

Some of the modifications done

* Made the jumpers between the bottom abd top longer to make wiring simpler and more reliable
* Glue (UV Glue for me) the jumpers to the Pizo speaker
* Place the Bluetooth module on top of the Motor controller board
* Glue(UV Glue) the power switch, Test it first before glueing, I destroyed the switch that came with the kit
* Test the Motor control board with just the servos attached, do alignment, then wire the rest of the modules



The following videos from Robot Creation are very useful in the build process.

== Wiring

The Otto Plus has two extra modules

. Bluetooth communication
. Microphone

One of the frustrating things was the locating the wiring diagram for these two modules.

The diagram was located in the V10 construction Guide, which is at this offline link:documents/OttoDIY_Manual_V10.pdf[ link]

The actual wiring diagram is on page 18.

== Programming

Otto can be programmed using Arduino or Blockly (GUI), started with Arduino because I'm a masochist.

Blockly is a great alternative if you are not comfortable with Arduino, just be prepared for many of the example `sketches` to not work properly.

Blockly sketches can be viewed and copied as the Arduino C++ code, and used directly in the Arduino IDE.



=== Arduino

The most current version of the Ardunio IDE as of this document date is 1.8.19 and can be downloaded from this link:files/arduino-1.8.19-windows.exe[Link, window='_blank']

To download the most current version of the Ardunio IDE use this web https://www.arduino.cc/en/software[Link,window='_blank']

In order to use Arduino to upload code to Otto the Arduino libraries need to be installed.
////
There is a video on `How to Calibrate Otto DIY` outlines the Arduino libraries process.  Unfortunately the Zip file discussed in this video has not been located.

The `How to Calibrate Otto DIY` video can be viewed or downloaded from this link::videos/CalibrateOtto.mp4[Video Link, window="_blank"]

.Calibrate Otto
video::videos/CalibrateOtto.mp4[Calibrate Otto, width=640, height=480, start=0, end=999999, align='center']
////


Download the *latest* version of the Otto library from GIT at this https://github.com/OttoDIY/OttoDIYLib[Link, window='_blank']

There is a local copy of the Arduino library in these notes at this link:files/OttoDIYLib-master.zip[Link, window='_blank']

. Download the .zip Otto libraries here link:fileslarge/OttoDIYLib-master.zip[Download, window='_blank']
. Open Arduino IDE and navigate to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library. At the top of the drop down list, select the option to `Add .ZIP Library`
. You will be prompted to select the library. Navigate to the .zip file's location, that you just downloaded and open it.
. In the main window you will see in the bottom back area a message that it has been installed.
. To verify they are properly installed, go to Sketch -> Include Library menu. You should now see the library at the bottom of the drop-down menu That means is ready to use Otto example codes! you can find them in File -> Examples -> OttoDIYLib for more details or other way to install libraries visit this link


IMPORTANT: Set the device to `Ardunio Nano` for Otto.

IMPORTANT:  The Boot loader is the AtMega 328 (Old Bootloader) because the mini in Otto is a clone.

==== Determine and set Comm port

The Ardunio IDE when used with the USB Port is assigned to a Comm port.

Open the Device Manager and then click on the `Ports (Comm  & LPT)` there may be some ports already assigned to other serial devices.

Plug in Blockly to a USB port, listen for the Window beep acknowledging Blockly,  and watch the `Ports (Comm  & LPT)` for a new comm port to be assigned.

.Ports

==== Sample Ardunio Script

There is a very small script that will cycle the Servos, this is like a confidence script that the Nano is working and the code is getting loaded.

.Sample servo test
----
include::files/Otto_ServoTest.ino[Servo Test]
----

A offline copy of the servo test can be downloaded from this link:files/Otto_ServoTest.ino[link, windows='_blank']

This test will move the servos to the Left, then to the right, then back to center.

CAUTION: This script could cause the legs to rotate to far to the left or right causing the servo arm to get stripped.  PITA.

=== Servo Alignment

Alignment is *Critical!!*, this step can *not* be skipped.

The legs are aligned separately from the feet.

After the alignment of the legs/Feet are complete the setting must be written into memory, so when the Otto is restarted it has the proper `Home` position.


=== Blockly 

There are two `BLOC` example scripts to help test the assembled Otto.

These two scripts are in the `Examples` of Blockly image:xxyyzz-place-image-here.png[]

*Alignment Serial* - Align the legs and feet and write the settings into Otto memory.  These settings are used to set Otto to default home position when a new BLOC is started.

*Alignment Walk* - Test Otto walking, check Otto walks straight as possible.

There are other BLOC's to test the Pizo speaker, touch sensor and the ultrasonic sensor

The Dance BLOC is a very good script to show Otto dancing, great way to check Otto working

By combing the Dance, touch sensor and Pizo BLOCs together the BLOC below was designed.

.BLOC Diagram

This OTTO BLOC can be downloaded from this link:https://xxyyzz.com[Link,window="_blank"]

When the BLOC is converted to C++ to Otto it looks like


== Bluetooth

A special Ardunio script is required for using the OTTO app on the cellphone.

.Bluetooth Script
[source,arduino]
----
Insert code here
----



The OTTO app must be downloaded into the phone.
This app has functions to do movements, play sounds, and if an LED matrix is attached show emoticons.
The code examples can be used to integrate Bluetooth into new scripts.

There is an Arduino script to upload to OTTO, which will enable the Bluetooth function.

It is located in the Arduino examples under OttoDIYLib / Bluetooth / Otto_PLUS_APP_V9.ino.

There is also a Blockly BLOC for testing the bluetooth functions.
